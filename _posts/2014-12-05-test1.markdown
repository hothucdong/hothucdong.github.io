Every year across America motorcyclists will throw on their leather jackets and hit the open road for charity. Some riders will get on their bikes and travel for organizations such as the Wounded Warrior Project, or other charities that support Autism awareness, cancer research or heart disease prevention. Raising money for charitable organizations is always a noble cause and riding a motorcycle to contribute to that effort is something many motorcycle riders enjoy being a part of. In fact, many of these charitable campaigns are not only using automotive technology to get from point A to point B but also social media. Facebook, twitter and microblogs are spreading the word about these motorcycle rides for good and helping them better connect with their audience with the help of GPS vehicle tracker systems.
GPS Tracking Systems Go Social

Social networking is now commonplace in the United States and with over 150 million active Facebook users in the US and Canada alone it is likely to going to be one of the ways people connect with one another moving forward (Facebook has over one billion users worldwide). Whether the choice is Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus or any of the other trendy social networks there is no denying that people are actively calling upon digital devices and mobile technology to connect with one another and this is where GPS tracking can play a unique role. See when a GPS device is connected to a person, automobile or asset it has the ability to provide real-time updates on the locations of those items. This real-time tracking data is not only accurate and beneficial for a number of different applications such as teen safety, senior care and vehicle management, but it can also provide a way for charity motorcycle runs to expand their reach and connection.
Motorcycle Rides For Charity & GPS Tracking

When a motorcycle rider opts to put a GPS vehicle tracker system on their bike they have the ability to not only locate that vehicle 24/7 but also the ability to share that tracking data. This combination is actually quite significant because with the use of a motorcycle GPS system the motorcycle rider can not only protect their property from theft but share their travels on social networks to enhance awareness for their cause. "Motorcycle riders and charities that involve lengthy motorcycle rides frequently contact us regarding real-time monitoring solutions and they are always pleased to hear that we have a system in place that allows them to share tracking data with the simple copy and paste of some HTML code", explained a sales associate for Tracking System Direct. "With this easy to generate HTML code the charity can post on their website, blog or social networking channels where motorcycle riders are located. Real-time GPS technology is a really cool way to engage the audience and tool to maximize viewership."
GPS Best For Real-Time Tracking Of Motorcycles

The majority of motorcycle charity events last anywhere from a day or upwards of a week. That means the motorcycle riders or event organizers usually seek live GPS systems that are both portable and that do not require any lengthy subscription fees (real-time GPS devices send data and therefore require a monthly service obligation and occasionally an annual contract). This is the reason one of the most popular live trackers is a device called Tag. What makes Tag the GPS tracker called upon is that the device is small (roughly the size of a pack of chewing gum), affordable ($199.00) and does not require any annual commitments for real-time service. All the motorcycle rider would have to pay is the hardware cost and the monthly fees for data which run as low as $1 a day.
